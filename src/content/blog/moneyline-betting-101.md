## What is Moneyline Betting?

Moneyline betting is the most basic form of sports wagering. You simply pick which team or player will win the game or match. There are no point spreads to cover, no totals to worry about—just pick the winner.

### The Basics

- **Pick the winner:** That's it. If your team wins, you win
- **No spreads or handicaps:** The final score margin doesn't matter
- **Different payouts:** Favorites pay less, underdogs pay more
- **Available for all sports:** From football to tennis to MMA

### Why Choose Moneyline Bets?

Moneyline bets are perfect for:
- **Beginners** who want to start simple
- **Heavy favorites** where spreads are too large
- **Close games** where you're confident in the winner but not the margin
- **Parlays** where you need teams to simply win

## How to Read Moneyline Odds

Moneyline odds use the American odds format with positive and negative numbers. If you're not familiar with American odds, [read our complete guide here](/guides/how-to-read-sports-betting-odds).

### Negative Odds (Favorites)

Negative numbers indicate the favorite—the team expected to win.

**Example: Chiefs -200**
- The Chiefs are favored
- You must bet $200 to win $100
- The larger the negative number, the bigger the favorite

### Positive Odds (Underdogs)

Positive numbers indicate the underdog—the team expected to lose.

**Example: Raiders +170**
- The Raiders are underdogs
- A $100 bet wins $170
- The larger the positive number, the bigger the underdog

### Real Example: NFL Game

**Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins**
- Bills -155
- Dolphins +135

This means:
- Bills are moderate favorites
- $155 on Bills wins $100
- $100 on Dolphins wins $135

## Calculating Moneyline Payouts

Understanding how to calculate payouts helps you make informed decisions and compare value across different bets.

### Favorite Payout Formula

For negative odds:
```
Profit = (Bet Amount / |Odds|) × 100
Total Payout = Bet Amount + Profit
```

**Example: $150 bet on -200 favorite**
- Profit = ($150 / 200) × 100 = $75
- Total Payout = $150 + $75 = $225

### Underdog Payout Formula

For positive odds:
```
Profit = (Bet Amount × Odds) / 100
Total Payout = Bet Amount + Profit
```

**Example: $100 bet on +250 underdog**
- Profit = ($100 × 250) / 100 = $250
- Total Payout = $100 + $250 = $350

### Quick Reference Table

| Moneyline Odds | $100 Bet Wins | Total Return | Implied Probability |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| -300           | $33.33        | $133.33      | 75.0%            |
| -200           | $50.00        | $150.00      | 66.7%            |
| -150           | $66.67        | $166.67      | 60.0%            |
| -110           | $90.91        | $190.91      | 52.4%            |
| +110           | $110.00       | $210.00      | 47.6%            |
| +150           | $150.00       | $250.00      | 40.0%            |
| +200           | $200.00       | $300.00      | 33.3%            |
| +300           | $300.00       | $400.00      | 25.0%            |

## Moneyline vs. Point Spread

When should you bet the moneyline instead of the spread? Let's compare both options to help you decide.

### When Moneyline Beats Spread

**1. Heavy Favorites in Low-Scoring Sports**

In NFL or NHL games with large spreads, moneyline often provides better value.

**Example:**
- Patriots -10 (-110) spread
- Patriots -400 moneyline

If you're confident the Patriots will win but worried about a 10-point cover, the moneyline might be smarter despite lower payout.

**2. Small Underdogs You Think Will Win**

When you believe an underdog will win outright, moneyline pays more than spread.

**Example:**
- Lakers +3.5 (-110) spread pays $90.91 per $100
- Lakers +150 moneyline pays $150 per $100

If you think the Lakers will win, why not take the bigger payout?

### When Spread Beats Moneyline

**1. Close Games with Even Odds**

In pick 'em games, spreads offer better payouts.

**Example:**
- Celtics -1 (-110) spread
- Celtics -130 moneyline

The spread pays better for essentially the same bet.

**2. Large Underdogs**

Getting points provides insurance for competitive losses.

**Example:**
- Jets +14 (-110) spread
- Jets +500 moneyline

The Jets can lose by 13 and still win your spread bet.

### The Correlation Formula

Use this simple math to compare:
- If the moneyline pays MORE than the spread profit, consider moneyline
- If the moneyline pays LESS than the spread profit, stick with spread

## Sport-Specific Moneyline Strategies

Different sports require different moneyline approaches based on scoring patterns and game dynamics.

### NFL Moneyline Strategy

**Key Factors:**
- Home field worth 2.5-3 points
- Divisional games stay closer
- Weather impacts scoring
- Prime time favorites often overvalued

**Best Spots:**
- Home underdogs in division games
- Road favorites of -3 or less (often better than spread)
- Live betting after early turnovers

### NBA Moneyline Strategy

**Key Factors:**
- Back-to-backs create fatigue
- Home court worth 2-3 points
- Tanking impacts late season
- Star players' rest decisions

**Best Spots:**
- Rested home teams vs. tired road teams
- Elite teams after losses (bounce-back spots)
- First half moneylines to avoid garbage time

### MLB Moneyline Strategy

**Unique Aspects:**
- No point spreads (run line is always 1.5)
- Starting pitchers crucial
- Bullpen usage matters
- Weather/wind affects totals

**Best Spots:**
- Ace pitchers as small road favorites
- Home underdogs with hot bats
- Day games after night games (fatigue factor)

### NHL Moneyline Strategy

**Key Factors:**
- Low scoring increases variance
- Goalies can steal games
- Three-point games (OT/SO losses)
- Back-to-back impacts

**Best Spots:**
- Elite goalies as underdogs
- Home teams in revenge spots
- Regulation moneylines for better odds

### Soccer Moneyline Strategy

**Three-Way Markets:**
- Win, Lose, or Draw options
- No overtime in regular betting
- Draw no bet option available

**Best Spots:**
- Home favorites in must-win situations
- Asian handicap alternatives
- Live betting after red cards

## Finding Value in Moneyline Bets

Value betting is the key to long-term profitability. Here's how to identify valuable moneyline opportunities.

### Understanding Implied Probability

Every moneyline has an implied probability—the chance the odds suggest a team will win.

**Formula:**
- Negative odds: Implied Probability = |Odds| / (|Odds| + 100)
- Positive odds: Implied Probability = 100 / (Odds + 100)

**Example:**
- -150 odds = 150 / (150 + 100) = 60% implied probability
- +200 odds = 100 / (200 + 100) = 33.3% implied probability

### Finding Value

Value exists when your estimated probability exceeds the implied probability.

**Example Value Calculation:**
- Yankees +140 (implied probability: 41.7%)
- Your analysis: Yankees have 50% chance to win
- Expected Value: Positive (50% > 41.7%)

### Line Shopping is Crucial

Different sportsbooks offer different moneylines. Always compare:

**Example:**
- DraftKings: Packers -165
- FanDuel: Packers -170
- BetMGM: Packers -160

Betting at BetMGM saves you money on the same bet.

### Exploiting Public Bias

The public loves favorites and popular teams, creating value on underdogs:
- Primetime games see inflated favorite lines
- Popular teams (Cowboys, Lakers) often overvalued
- Week 1 overreactions create Week 2 value

## Common Moneyline Betting Mistakes

Avoid these costly errors that hurt moneyline bettors.

### 1. Ignoring Heavy Juice on Favorites

**Mistake:** Betting -300 favorites thinking they're "sure things"

**Reality:** You need to win 75% of -300 bets just to break even. One loss wipes out three wins.

### 2. Parlaying Heavy Favorites

**Mistake:** "I'll parlay five -400 favorites for easy money!"

**Math:** Five -400 favorites = approximately +108 parlay odds
**Risk:** One upset kills entire ticket for minimal payout

### 3. Not Converting to Implied Probability

**Mistake:** Seeing +300 and thinking "big payout!" without considering 25% implied probability

**Better approach:** Ask yourself if the team truly has a 25%+ chance to win

### 4. Emotional Betting on Favorites

**Mistake:** "The Chiefs can't lose to the Jaguars at home!"

**Reality:** Any given Sunday. Upsets happen more than heavy odds suggest.

### 5. Ignoring Alternative Markets

**Mistake:** Only betting standard moneylines

**Opportunities missed:**
- First half moneylines
- Regulation time (NHL/Soccer)
- Alternative spreads converted to moneyline value

## Advanced Moneyline Concepts

Take your moneyline betting to the next level with these advanced strategies.

### Arbitrage Opportunities

Sometimes different sportsbooks create arbitrage opportunities:

**Example:**
- Book A: Team X +220
- Book B: Team Y -180

Betting both guarantees profit regardless of outcome.

### Correlated Parlays

Some books allow correlated moneyline parlays:
- First half + Full game same team
- Multiple ways to win with correlation

### Live Moneyline Betting

In-game moneylines offer unique value:
- Overreactions to early scores
- Momentum shifts
- Hedging opportunities

**Strategy:** Pre-game favorite down early often provides value

### Moneyline to Spread Conversion

Understanding the relationship helps identify value:

| Point Spread | Approximate ML Favorite | Approximate ML Underdog |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| -1           | -105 to -115          | -105 to +105          |
| -2.5         | -130 to -140          | +110 to +120          |
| -3           | -145 to -165          | +125 to +145          |
| -7           | -300 to -350          | +250 to +300          |
| -10          | -450 to -600          | +350 to +450          |

### Expected Value Calculation

The key to profitable betting:

```
EV = (Win Probability × Win Amount) - (Loss Probability × Loss Amount)
```

**Example:**
- Bet: $100 on +150 underdog
- Your estimated win probability: 45%
- EV = (0.45 × $150) - (0.55 × $100)
- EV = $67.50 - $55 = +$12.50

Positive EV = Good bet over time

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does moneyline mean in betting?

Moneyline betting means wagering on which team will win the game outright. Unlike spread betting, the margin of victory doesn't matter—only who wins.

### Is moneyline a good bet?

Moneyline bets are good when:
- You're confident in a winner but not the margin
