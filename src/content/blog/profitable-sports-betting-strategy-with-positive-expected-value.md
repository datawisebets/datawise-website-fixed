# Understanding Vig: The Hidden Cost in Betting

Positive expected value (EV) sports betting is a powerful concept that can help you make smarter wagers and improve your long-term profitability. In a nutshell, positive EV sports betting means placing bets only when the odds are in your favor, giving you an edge over the sportsbook.

At datawise, we specialize in providing cutting-edge sports betting software that helps you identify and capitalize on these positive EV opportunities.

> "The vig is like a tax that sportsbooks charge on your bets, and it's how they make their money. Understanding and overcoming the vig is essential to profitable betting."

The "vig" is also called the "juice" or "take." When you see a betting line like -110, that means for every $110 you bet, you'll win $100 if you're right. The extra $10 is the vig.

Sportsbooks set the vig so that they'll make a profit in the long run, even if they have to pay out on some bets. The vig makes it harder to be a profitable bettor, because you have to win more than 50% of the time to come out ahead.

## How to Find Positive Expected Value

To overcome the vig, you need to find bets where you think the real chances of winning are better than what the betting odds say - this means you'll have a positive expected value on those bets.

The formula for calculating EV is:

**EV = (Probability of Winning × Amount Won per Bet) - (Probability of Losing × Amount Lost per Bet)**

## Case Studies: Successful Positive EV Sports Betting

Here's an example of how positive EV sports betting works in the real world. Let's say the Golden State Warriors are playing the Los Angeles Lakers. One sportsbook has the Warriors as a 5-point favorite at -110 odds. But based on your research and analysis, you think the Warriors should be a 7-point favorite. Understanding [what is a point spread](./what-is-a-point-spread.md) is crucial for making these assessments.

That means there's value in betting on them -5, because the odds are better than they should be based on the real chances of that happening. If you consistently place bets like this where the odds are in your favor, you'll make money in the long run even if you don't win every single bet.

### Key Elements of a Winning Strategy

- **Line Shopping:** Compare odds across multiple sportsbooks to find the best value
- **Specialization:** Focus on specific leagues or sports to develop deeper knowledge
- **Bankroll Management:** Use proper staking to maximize growth while minimizing risk - this is [the biggest sports betting mistake](./biggest-sports-betting-mistake-bankroll-management.md) many bettors make
- **Record Keeping:** Track all bets to analyze performance and refine your approach

It's all about finding spots where the sportsbooks have made a mistake in pricing the odds, and taking advantage. Of course, it takes a lot of knowledge and experience to accurately assess when the odds are off, but that's how the pros do it.
