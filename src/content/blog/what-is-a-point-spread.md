Point spread betting is the most popular way to bet on football and basketball. Unlike moneyline bets where you simply pick the winner, spread betting levels the playing field between mismatched teams. This comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know about point spreads, including how they work, real examples from the NFL and NBA, and strategies for finding value.

## What is a Point Spread?

A point spread is a handicap placed on the favorite team to even out the betting action between two mismatched opponents. Instead of betting on who wins, you're betting on the margin of victory.

### The Basics

- The **favorite** (expected winner) "gives" points (shown with a minus sign: -7)
- The **underdog** (expected loser) "gets" points (shown with a plus sign: +7)
- To win a spread bet on the favorite, they must win by MORE than the spread
- To win a spread bet on the underdog, they must either win outright OR lose by LESS than the spread

### Why Point Spreads Exist

Imagine the Kansas City Chiefs playing a college team. Everyone would bet on the Chiefs to win outright. Point spreads create balanced betting by making both sides equally attractive to bettors.

## How Point Spreads Work

Let's break down exactly how spread betting works with a clear example.

### Example: Cowboys vs. Eagles

**Point Spread:**
- Dallas Cowboys +3.5 (-110)
- Philadelphia Eagles -3.5 (-110)

**What this means:**
- Eagles are 3.5-point favorites
- Cowboys are 3.5-point underdogs
- Both sides pay -110 ([learn about -110 odds here](/guides/how-to-read-sports-betting-odds))

### Possible Outcomes

**If you bet on Eagles -3.5:**
- ✅ WIN: Eagles win by 4+ points (e.g., 27-20)
- ❌ LOSE: Eagles win by 3 or fewer, or Cowboys win

**If you bet on Cowboys +3.5:**
- ✅ WIN: Cowboys win OR lose by 3 or fewer (e.g., 24-21 Eagles)
- ❌ LOSE: Eagles win by 4+ points

### The Half-Point Hook

Notice the ".5" in the spread? This is called "the hook" and eliminates ties (pushes). With Cowboys +3.5, if the Eagles win by exactly 3, Cowboys bettors still win. Without the hook (Cowboys +3), the bet would push and stakes would be refunded.

## Reading Point Spread Odds

Understanding how to read spread odds is crucial for successful betting. Here's what you need to know:

### Standard Juice

Most point spreads come with -110 odds on both sides. This means:
- Bet $110 to win $100
- Bet $11 to win $10
- Bet $55 to win $50

The extra 10% is the sportsbook's commission (juice or vig).

### Alternative Lines

Sportsbooks offer alternative spreads with adjusted odds:

**Standard line:** Patriots -7 (-110)
**Alternative lines:**
- Patriots -3 (+150) - Easier to cover, lower payout
- Patriots -10 (-140) - Harder to cover, higher risk

### Live Spread Betting

Spreads change during games based on the score and time remaining. A team favored by -7 pregame might be -3.5 at halftime if they're underperforming.

## NFL Point Spread Examples

The NFL is the most popular sport for spread betting. Let's examine real-world examples to understand how spreads work in football.

### Example 1: Divisional Matchup

**Week 8, 2024: Steelers vs. Ravens**
- Opening line: Ravens -3
- Closing line: Ravens -3.5
- Final score: Ravens 26, Steelers 23

**Analysis:**
- Ravens covered the opening spread (won by 3)
- Ravens failed to cover the closing spread (needed to win by 4+)
- This shows why line shopping is crucial

### Example 2: Blowout Potential

**2024 Regular Season: Bills vs. Patriots**
- Spread: Bills -9.5
- Final score: Bills 34, Patriots 17

**Result:** Bills covered easily, winning by 17 points. This illustrates how dominant teams can cover large spreads against weaker opponents.

### NFL Spread Betting Tips

1. **Home field advantage** is typically worth 2.5-3 points
2. **Divisional games** tend to be closer than spreads suggest
3. **Prime time unders** - Teams often play conservatively in big games
4. **Weather matters** - Wind and snow favor unders and underdogs

## NBA Point Spread Examples

NBA spreads work the same way but with some key differences due to the nature of basketball.

### Example 1: Home Favorite

**2024 Regular Season: Lakers vs. Wizards**
- Spread: Lakers -8.5
- Final score: Lakers 115, Wizards 103

**Result:** Lakers covered by winning by 12. Home court advantage in the NBA is typically worth 2-3 points.

### Example 2: Back-to-Back Impact

**Celtics on second night of back-to-back:**
- Spread: Celtics -5.5 (would normally be -8)
- Final score: Celtics 108, Magic 104

**Result:** Celtics failed to cover. Fatigue from back-to-back games often impacts spread performance.

### NBA-Specific Factors

1. **Rest advantage** - Teams with 2+ days rest vs. tired opponents
2. **Pace of play** - Fast-paced teams can cover larger spreads
3. **Garbage time** - Blowouts often see benches empty, affecting final margins
4. **Tanking teams** - Late season motivations impact spread reliability

## Key Numbers in Spread Betting

Certain numbers appear more frequently as final margins, making them "key numbers" in spread betting.

### NFL Key Numbers

The most common margins of victory in NFL games:
1. **3 points** (field goal) - ~15% of games
2. **7 points** (touchdown) - ~9% of games
3. **10 points** (touchdown + field goal) - ~6% of games
4. **6 points** (two field goals) - ~5% of games

### Why Key Numbers Matter

Getting +3.5 instead of +2.5 is massive in NFL betting. You win if your team loses by the most common margin (3 points).

**Example value calculation:**
- Team A +2.5 (-110) vs. Team A +3.5 (-120)
- The extra half-point is worth paying slightly worse odds

### NBA Key Numbers

NBA has less pronounced key numbers due to:
- Free throws creating odd margins
- Three-pointers adding variance
- Higher scoring reducing percentage impact

Most common NBA margins: 5, 7, 3, 8, 6 (in order)

## Strategies for Betting Spreads

Successful spread betting requires more than picking winners. Here are proven strategies to find value.

### 1. Shop for the Best Number

Different sportsbooks offer different spreads. Even half-point differences matter:

**Example:**
- DraftKings: Patriots -6.5
- FanDuel: Patriots -7
- BetMGM: Patriots -6.5

Always bet at the book offering the best number for your side.

### 2. Buy Points Strategically

Some sportsbooks let you "buy" half-points for -120 or -125 odds. This is valuable around key numbers:

**Worth buying:**
- +2.5 to +3 (crosses key number 3)
- +6.5 to +7 (crosses key number 7)

**Not worth buying:**
- +8.5 to +9 (no key number benefit)

### 3. Understand Situational Spots

Certain situations create spread betting value:

**Fade the public in prime time:** Popular teams get inflated spreads in national TV games

**Back home dogs on Thursdays:** Short weeks favor home teams, even underdogs

**Division underdogs:** Familiarity keeps games closer than spreads suggest

### 4. Track Line Movement

Lines move based on betting action and new information:

**Sharp movement:** Quick movement on low limits indicates professional action

**Public movement:** Gradual movement on high limits shows recreational betting

Following sharp money often provides value.

## Common Spread Betting Mistakes

Avoid these costly errors that plague beginning spread bettors.

### 1. Ignoring Key Numbers

**Mistake:** Betting Chiefs -7.5 (-110) when -7 (-115) is available

**Why it matters:** You lose if Chiefs win by exactly 7—one of the most common margins

### 2. Overvaluing Recent Performance

**Mistake:** "The Bills scored 40+ points in three straight games, they'll cover -10 easily!"

**Reality:** Regression to the mean is real. Hot streaks don't guarantee future covers.

### 3. Falling for Trap Lines

**Mistake:** "Patriots only -3 against the Jets? That's free money!"

**Reality:** When lines look too good to be true, they usually are. Vegas knows something you don't.

### 4. Chasing Steam

**Mistake:** Betting a line after it's already moved significantly

**Better approach:** Get ahead of line movement or find value on the other side

### 5. Ignoring Context

**Mistake:** Not considering rest, travel, injuries, or motivation

**Example:** Betting against a team on the second night of a back-to-back in the NBA without adjusting expectations

## Advanced Spread Concepts

Once you master the basics, these advanced concepts will elevate your spread betting.

### Middling Opportunities

When lines move significantly, you can bet both sides for a potential "middle" win.

**Example:**
1. Bet Cowboys +7 early in the week
2. Line moves to Cowboys +3
3. Bet Eagles -3
4. If Eagles win by 4-6, both bets win!

### Teasing Spreads

A teaser lets you adjust multiple spreads in your favor for reduced odds.

**6-point NFL teaser example:**
- Original: Chiefs -8, Bills -7
- Teased: Chiefs -2, Bills -1
- Both must cover for reduced payout

### First Half Spreads

Betting first half spreads eliminates garbage time and late-game variance.

**When to use:**
- Backing superior teams that may rest starters late
- Fading teams known for slow starts
- Avoiding backdoor covers

### Live Spread Betting

In-game spreads offer unique opportunities:
- Overreactions to early scoring
- Momentum shifts creating value
- Hedging pregame bets

**Tip:** Have accounts at multiple books to capture the best live lines quickly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does "covering the spread" mean?

Covering the spread means winning a point spread bet. The favorite covers by winning by more than the spread. The underdog covers by losing by less than the spread (or winning outright).

### What happens if the game lands exactly on the spread?

If there's no half-point (hook), the bet is a push and your stake is refunded. For example, if you bet Patriots -7 and they win 28-21, the bet pushes.

### Is it better to bet spreads or moneylines?

It depends on the situation:
- **Bet spreads** when you think a game will be close
- **Bet moneyline** when you love an underdog to win outright
- **Consider both** to find the best value

### How are point spreads determined?

Sportsbooks use:
- Power ratings for each team
- Home field advantage
- Injuries and availability
- Weather conditions
- Historical matchup data
- Public betting tendencies

### Can spreads change after I bet?

Your bet is locked at the spread you took. If you bet Cowboys +3, that's your number even if the line moves to +5.

### What's the difference between -110 and -105 odds?

The odds indicate the juice (commission). At -110, you bet $110 to win $100. At -105, you bet $105 to win $100. Always seek the best price (closest to -100).

### Should I buy points around key numbers?

Generally, yes. Moving from +2.5 to +3 in the NFL is often worth paying -120 instead of -110. Use a betting calculator to determine if the juice is worth the improved number.
