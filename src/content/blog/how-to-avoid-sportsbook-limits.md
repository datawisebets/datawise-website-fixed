# How To Avoid Sportsbook Limits

Sportsbooks want to be profitable just like you and I. They manage risk and limit accounts they perceive as too skilled or potentially unprofitable for their business. This includes accounts that consistently win, particularly through strategies like arbitrage betting, sharp betting on soft lines, or exploiting promotional offers.

## Disclaimer: This guide is not for everyone!

If you recently started sports betting, this isn't something I personally would be too concerned about. Fully taking advantage of current opportunities can jump start your bankroll and open up more options.

### Who this is for:
- Limited on most DFS apps & sportsbooks
- Running out of options to get money down
- Focused on long term profitability

### Who this is NOT for:
- Recently started sports betting
- Have NOT been limited on any DFS apps or sportsbooks
- Focused on making money TODAY & doesn't care about long term account health

## Strategies for Maintaining Account Health

### 1. Act Like The Recreational Bettor They Want

**Initial Bets are VITAL**: Your first few bets are scrutinized. Early on, avoid maxing out on soft lines or bonuses. Instead, place smaller, diversified bets that mimic recreational betting patterns. From my experience, this is one of the most crucial aspects.

**Engage with the Platform**: Spend time navigating the sportsbook app, adding various bets to your slip, and not just picking of value bets. This behavior mirrors that of a recreational bettor who gambles for entertainment.

### 2. Smart Betting Practices

**Avoid Clear Errors**: Betting on obvious errors or lines that are too good to be true can flag your account. Sportsbooks may void these bets and mark your account for closer observation.

**Balance Your Betting**: Mix in bets on popular events or teams, especially your local teams, to blend in with the crowd. This approach helps mask your bets.

**Vary Bet Types**: Utilize parlays, straight bets, and live bets. Recreational bettors often place parlays, so including these can help disguise your account.

### 3. Utilize Promotions Wisely

**Don't Max Out Bonuses**: Use promotions, but avoid exploiting them to the fullest. For example, if a bonus requires a $5 bet for a reward, consider betting slightly more to appear less calculated.

### 4. Diversify Your Betting Action

**Spread Your Action**: Don't focus all your betting on a single sportsbook. Use multiple platforms to dilute your winning profile across various services.

### 5. Cover Plays and Variance

**Embrace Losing Bets**: Occasionally placing bets that are not expected to win can improve the perceived health of your account by introducing variance.

**Casino and Other Games**: Light engagement with casino games or non-sports betting options can further blend your profile with recreational gamblers.

### 6. Monitor Your Account Health

**Watch for Warning Signs**: Decreased promotional offers, bets taking longer to be accepted, or reduced bet limits can indicate your account is under scrutiny. Sometimes mixing in some more recreational action can help, other times it is too late.

## Even by taking these steps there's no guarantee to avoiding limits.
